# Random Forest with Smile & Tablesaw

While standard linear regression (introduced in the <a href="https://jtablesaw.github.io/tablesaw/userguide/ml/Moneyball%20Linear%20regression">Moneyball tutorial</a>) is widely used and works well for a variety of problems, tree-based regression methods provide excellent results and be applied to numerical and categorical data, maintain much of the interprebility of classical linear regression, and require no  data preparation/normalization as no assumption of linearity is made. 

This tutorial is based on Chapter 8 (Tree Based Methods) of the widely used and freely available textbook <a href="https://www.statlearning.com/">An Introduction to Statistical Learning, Second Edition</a>.
